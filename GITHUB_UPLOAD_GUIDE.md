# GitHub Upload Guide for Y-It.Shop

## üöÄ Quick Upload to GitHub

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Go to [github.com/hagermann00](https://github.com/hagermann00)
2. Click "New repository" or go to existing `y-it.shop` repo
3. Repository name: `y-it.shop`
4. Set to Public (required for GitHub Pages with free account)
5. Don't initialize with README (we have our own files)

### Step 2: Upload Files
**Option A: Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop ALL files from this folder
3. Commit message: "Initial Y-It Systems website deployment"
4. Click "Commit changes"

**Option B: Git Commands**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hagermann00/y-it.shop.git
cd y-it.shop
# Copy all files from this package into the cloned directory
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Y-It Systems website deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Branch: `gh-pages` (will be created automatically by GitHub Actions)
5. Folder: `/ (root)`

### Step 4: Configure Custom Domain
1. In Pages settings, add custom domain: `y-it.shop`
2. Check "Enforce HTTPS"
3. GitHub will verify domain ownership

### Step 5: DNS Configuration
Configure your domain registrar with these DNS records:

**A Records:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

**CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: hagermann00.github.io
```
